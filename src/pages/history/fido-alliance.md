# FIDO Alliance
The [FIDO (Fast IDentity Online) Alliance](https://fidoalliance.org/) is an open industry association of leading technology companies that works to develop, promote, and establish open standards for stronger authentication. Their mission is to create “authentication standards to help reduce the world’s over-reliance on passwords.” It was launched publicly in 2013 and has since grown to include over 300 companies.
