WebAuthn, and commitments from tech giants like Apple, Google, and Microsoft to implement and support the specification, brings the world one big step closer to a passwordless future. With WebAuthn, users can authenticate to websites in their browser using the same mechanism they use to unlock their device, including PIN, pattern, and biometric options. This website serves as a go-to guide for developers to learn more about WebAuthn and how to start using it in your applications.

# Overview
WebAuthn (short for Web Authentication) is the API specification that enables applications to use strong and secure authentication methods for user registration and login. It provides a way for end users to authenticate themselves using hardware- or software-based [authenticators](/how-it-works/authenticators), such as USB security keys or secure hardware elements integrated with a laptop or mobile device, instead of relying solely on passwords.

These authenticators rely on public-key cryptography to provide secure registration and authentication of accounts scoped to a secure domain. To achieve this, the user completes a [registration](/how-it-works/registration) ceremony to associate an authenticator device with their account, which generates a public-private key pair.

The private key is stored securely on the user's device while the public key is registered with the web application server. During login the user verifies their identity by completing an [authentication](/how-it-works/authentication) ceremony registered device, and the server validates the signature using the previously registered public key.

As a developer you can use WebAuthn to provide your users with a more secure and user-friendly authentication mechanism. It is supported by most modern web browsers and platforms, and open-source libraries and identity platforms streamline integration with your existing authentication flow.

# What are passkeys?
The public-private key pair generated by an authenticator is the user's credential in WebAuthn world, as opposed to a more traditional username and password. The term "passkey" started as a way to describe WebAuthn credentials that can be synced between devices using an external mechanism, but it has since become the common way to refer to any WebAuthn credential. Passkeys that are not synced between devices are referred to as "device-bound passkeys."

Syncing passkeys between devices is outside the scope of the WebAuthn specification. It is up to the platform or operating system to securely share passkeys across compatible devices. For example, Apple uses its iCloud Keychain and Google uses Google Password Manager to make passkeys available across devices.
