# What is a WebAuthn device?
A WebAuthn device is a hardware device or authenticator that supports the WebAuthn specification, which is a standard for passwordless authentication on the web. A WebAuthn device can be either a platform authenticator, such as a biometric sensor built into a device, or a roaming authenticator, such as a USB security key or mobile phone

# What is WebAuthn protocol?
WebAuthn is a standard for passwordless authentication on the web. It is a web API that allows websites and web applications to offer users the ability to authenticate themselves using strong cryptographic credentials, such as public key cryptography, rather than passwords.

# Is WebAuthn a 2fa?
Yes, WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a form of 2FA (two-factor authentication). WebAuthn allows users to authenticate themselves using a physical security key, such as a USB key, or a built-in biometric device, such as a fingerprint reader, in addition to their password. This provides an additional layer of security, making it much harder for attackers to gain access to user accounts even if they have obtained the user's password through a data breach or other means.

# What is FIDO2 and WebAuthn?
FIDO2 (Fast Identity Online 2.0) is an open authentication standard developed by the FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance. It consists of two components: WebAuthn (Web Authentication) and CTAP (Client to Authenticator Protocol).

# What is WebAuthn passwordless?
With WebAuthn passwordless authentication, users no longer have to remember complex passwords, which can be a security risk if they are reused across multiple websites or compromised in a data breach. Additionally, passwordless authentication can be faster and more convenient for users, especially on mobile devices where typing passwords can be difficult.

# What is the difference between WebAuthn and U2F?
WebAuthn (Web Authentication) and U2F (Universal 2nd Factor) are both open authentication standards developed by the FIDO (Fast Identity Online) Alliance. They share some similarities but have a few key differences. U2F is the predecessor of WebAuthn and is based on the use of physical security keys to authenticate users. But U2F does not use built-in biometric features in devices, whereas WebAuthn can use both device authenticators and physical authenticators.
